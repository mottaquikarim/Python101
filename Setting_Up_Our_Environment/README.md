# Setting Up Our Environment

## Running / Testing Python Code

We will use **[REPL.IT](https://repl.it/)** as a quick, fast, simple way to get started writing python code. REPL, or **R**ead, **E**dit, **P**lay, **L**oop allows us to run python code from our browser. You will need to create an account - but it's free!

After signing up, please visit **[this link](https://repl.it/languages)** and type in **PYTHON** to choose the correct python environment.

For the purposes of this course, this is greatly preferred! We don't have much time and we don't have time to work on getting stuff installed on a machine (which can have particular caveats based on type (ie: mac vs pc, etc)). Do note that we are essentially taking a shortcut for the sake of practicality - if you are interested in installing python *for realsies*, take a look at **[this documentation](https://github.com/mottaquikarim/PythonBootcamp/tree/master/Setting_Up_Our_Environment)** I wrote for another class.


## Setting up PythonAnywhere Account

Although wrangling the PyCharm / Anaconda set up described above will allow us to safely and happily write python code locally, it is in some ways severely limiting because we are not able to run long standing processes or communicate with our code from real world inputs.

In order to truly achieve freedom to do anything we want with python, we must configure an environment in the cloud that is accessible via the internet.

Normally, this is an expensive and skills-intensive process. But! The Future is Now fam, and our service based economy affords us the ability to relatively easily set up a python environment for experimenting around in the cloud for free(...mium).

Pls go to **[Python Anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)** and create a free account. If you find the service useful, feel free to upgrade later. For now, just create the account and verify that you can log in. We will have instructions for transferring some of our projects to the internets later on in the day.
