# Python101
*üéâüéàüéÇüçæüéäüçªüíÉ*

*A hands on and practical introduction
 to programming and python development.*

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce some fundamental concepts of software development. We will be using the python programming language, which provides a readable, powerful syntax that is used by data scientists, web developers, even NASA engineers! In particular, our aspiration in this workshop is to work up to a point where we can confidently and feasibly level up our python knowledge without external support from anyone. 

## Table of Contents
Here's the general game plan for the day.

### [1. Setting Up Our Environment](Setting_Up_Our_Environment)
Before we get into writing our code, we will have to install a few programs and tools. It may take about a half hr to pull off but ultimately a properly established development environment will pay off in spades as we navigate the rest of our day.

### [2. Basic Data Types](Basic_Data_Types)
We will begin by exploring some of the basics of the python programming language. For example, how can we keep track of data in python?

### [3. Functions](Functions)
In this section we will consider a core concept in programming: functions. Some questions we will answer: How does decision making work? Can we automate functionality so that we don't have to repeat ourselves? 

### [4. Lists and Dicts](Lists_and_Dicts)
Complex data and situations in real life can be modeled in python using data structures that are a bit more complex than the basic data types we previously covered. Here, we will discuss looping and modeling real world data in a "pythonic" manner.

### [5. Modules](Modules)
What makes python super useful is the existence of an ecosystem of code written by others and distributed for us to use - for free! We will explore how these items can be used to enhance our code.

### [6. Simple Webservice](Simple_Webservice)
How can we use python to power web services? What is a web service, anyways? In this section, we will cover such concepts and then delve into making our own, simple web service.
